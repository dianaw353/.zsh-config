# zsh-config

This is the .zsh config taken from https://github.com/dreamsofautonomy/zensh and https://github.com/dreamsofautonomy/zen-omp but modified to add oh-my-posh instead as powerlevel10k is on life support.

## Installation

Please install the following programs for everything to work using your prefered package manager such as paru:

`paru -S fzf zoxide zinit oh-my-posh`
